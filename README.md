Repository for the documents and programs of the JAMD UCRC team. Namely the MazeEmulator project

The MazeEmulator code allows us to create an artificial maze of some complexity in Java, then create a simulacrum of a MicroMouse robot in Java and have it run through the maze. The maze itself is generated using a slightly modified depth-first search which randomly chooses unvisited children to create branching corridors. Then we run the JAMDRobot instance, starting at 0,0 in the maze, and see how our code performs.
